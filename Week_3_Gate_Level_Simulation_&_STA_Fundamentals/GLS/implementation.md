## Purpose Of GLS

Gate-Level Simulation is used to verify the functionality of a design after the synthesis process. Unlike behavioral or RTL (Register Transfer Level) simulations, which are performed at a higher level of abstraction, GLS works on the netlist generated post-synthesis. This netlist includes the actual gates and connections used to implement the design.

# Here is the step-by-step execution plan for running the commands manually:

## Step 1: Load the Top-Level Design and Supporting Modules
