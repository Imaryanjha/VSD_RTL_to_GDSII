#  SPICE Netlist ‚Äì 

##  1Ô∏è‚É£ What is a SPICE Netlist?

A **SPICE netlist** is a plain text file that describes an **electronic circuit** in terms of:
- **Components** (transistors, resistors, capacitors, voltage sources, etc.)
- **Connections** (which nodes are linked)
- **Simulation commands** (analysis type, time step, etc.)

It is the **input file** for the SPICE simulator ‚Äî  
telling it **what circuit to simulate** and **how to simulate it**.

# Technology File
## üìò What is a Technology File?

A technology file defines the process-specific parameters of a semiconductor technology used for simulation, synthesis, and layout.
It acts as a bridge between design and fabrication, providing all the electrical, physical, and material details required by SPICE or layout tools.
## Key Information in a Technology File
| Parameter Type         | Description                                                                                                 |
| ---------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Layer Definitions**  | Defines each mask layer (e.g., poly, metal1, via1) and its properties.                                      |
| **Design Rules**       | Specifies minimum width, spacing, overlap, enclosure, etc.                                                  |
| **Device Parameters**  | Provides NMOS/PMOS model parameters like threshold voltage (Vth), mobility (¬µ), oxide thickness (tox), etc. |
| **RC Extraction Data** | Defines resistance and capacitance per unit length or area for interconnects.                               |
| **SPICE Models**       | Includes `.model` or `.lib` statements for transistor-level simulation.                                     |
| **Process Corners**    | Includes variations (TT, SS, FF) to simulate manufacturing conditions.                                      |
