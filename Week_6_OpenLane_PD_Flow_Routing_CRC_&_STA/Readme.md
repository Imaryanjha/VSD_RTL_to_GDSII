# Week 6 Task ‚Äì Physical Design Workshop

## üìå Objective
This task focuses on hands-on Physical Design labs using a pre-configured VDI image. You will explore the complete hierarchy of digital and mixed-signal design implementation ‚Äî from standard cell design to DRC and STA validation.

## üéØ Why This Task Is Important
- Bridges the gap between theory and real-world chip implementation
- Understand how hierarchical digital design integrates with custom analog/mixed-signal blocks
- Learn the interplay between layout, timing, and design rule checks (DRC)
- Appreciate how synthesis, STA, and layout interact to bring a design from RTL to physical silicon

## üõ†Ô∏è Lab Setup
1. Download the **Physical Design Tools VDI image** from:  
   [Google Drive Link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Ri30Yeqjyprv-rStHEScUMpKtw2JfVJe/view)
2. Follow the installation instructions to run the image on Windows using **Oracle VirtualBox**
3. Ensure your local environment is set up before starting the labs

## üìÇ Workshop Access
Once the environment is ready:
1. Log in to the **Physical Design Workshop**
2. Watch all the **lab demonstration videos**
3. Re-create each lab in your local VDI environment
4. Document your work in your **personal GitHub repository**

## üìù Documentation Format
Refer to this sample repository for style and structure:  
üîó [SoC Design and Planning (NASSCOM √ó VSD)](https://github.com/fayizferosh/soc-design-and-planning-nasscom-vsd/)

Your documentation should include:
- Lab objectives and context
- Screenshots of terminal outputs, tool GUIs, and layouts
- Short technical explanations for each step
- Reflections connecting labs to physical design concepts (floorplanning, placement, routing, DRC, STA)

## ‚úÖ Deliverables
- **GitHub Repository Documentation** with:
  - Screenshots of each lab step
  - Summary of key learnings per lab
  - Notes on digital and analog block interactions
  - Observations on DRC, LVS, and STA inter-dependencies
- **Proof of Setup:** Screenshot of your running VDI environment with your username in the Linux terminal

## üèÅ By the End of Week 6:
- Successfully set up and operate the Physical Design lab environment
- Perform and document multiple hierarchical physical design experiments
- Understand the complete flow from digital synthesis to layout verification and STA sign-off
- Integrate all previous weeks into one coherent learning path
