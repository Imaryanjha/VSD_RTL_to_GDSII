# What is PDK (Process Design Kit)?

## Introduction
A **Process Design Kit (PDK)** is a comprehensive collection of files and data provided by a semiconductor foundry.  
It defines the **rules, models, and parameters** required to design, simulate, and fabricate integrated circuits (ICs) using a specific manufacturing process (e.g., 130nm, 45nm, etc.).

The PDK acts as the **bridge between circuit designers and the fabrication process**, ensuring that the design is manufacturable and functions correctly on silicon.

## Contents of a PDK

A typical PDK contains the following components:

### 1. **Design Rules**
- Define the physical layout constraints (minimum spacing, width, layer overlap, etc.).
- Ensure manufacturability and yield reliability.
- Used in **Design Rule Check (DRC)** during layout verification.

### 2. **Device Models**
- Provide electrical characteristics of transistors, resistors, capacitors, etc.
- Used in **SPICE simulations** to predict circuit behavior.
- Example: NMOS/PMOS model parameters (threshold voltage, mobility, etc.).

### 3. **Layer Information**
- Describes each mask layer used in the fabrication process.
- Includes color codes, names, and mapping to physical layers in the layout tool.

### 4. **Technology Files**
- Define how the CAD tools (like Cadence, Magic, or KLayout) should interpret the process layers.
- Include setup for DRC, LVS, and extraction tools.

### 5. **PCell Libraries (Parameterized Cells)**
- Predefined, customizable cells for standard devices (e.g., MOSFETs, resistors, capacitors).
- Allow easy instantiation of devices in layout editors.

### 6. **Standard Cell Libraries**
- Include pre-designed logic gates (AND, OR, INV, etc.) optimized for that process node.
- Used in digital design and synthesis flows.

### 7. **Verification Decks**
- Scripts for **DRC (Design Rule Check)**, **LVS (Layout vs Schematic)**, and **PEX (Parasitic Extraction)**.
- Ensure layout accuracy and connectivity before tape-out.

## Example
- **SkyWater 130nm (SKY130 PDK)**: An open-source PDK released by Google & SkyWater Technology.  
  It allows anyone to design and fabricate chips using the 130nm process node.
