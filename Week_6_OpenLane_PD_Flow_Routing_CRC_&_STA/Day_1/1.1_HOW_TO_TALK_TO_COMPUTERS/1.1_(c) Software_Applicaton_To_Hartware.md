# Understanding Software and Hardware Interaction

This diagram illustrates the relationship between **application software**, **system software**, and **hardware**, and how programs are translated into machine-understandable instructions.

## 1. Application Software
Examples: Firefox, Acrobat Reader, MS Office, VirtualBox  
- These are user-level programs designed to perform specific tasks.  
- They rely on **system software** to communicate with the underlying hardware.

## 2. System Software
Examples: Windows, macOS, Linux  
- Acts as a bridge between applications and hardware.  
- Includes the **Operating System (OS)**, **Compiler**, and **Assembler**.

### Compiler
- Converts high-level language code (C, C++, Java, VB, etc.) into **machine instructions**.  
- Output: `.exe` (executable) file containing binary instructions.

### Assembler
- Translates low-level assembly instructions into **machine code** (binary format: 0s and 1s).  
- These instructions can be directly executed by the hardware.

### Instruction Set Architecture (ISA)
- Defines the interface between **software** and **hardware**.  
- Examples: x86, ARM, RISC-V.  
- It specifies how instructions are represented and executed in the hardware.

## 3. Hardware
- The physical layer of the computer where **machine code** is executed.  
- Includes logic gates, transistors, and circuits that process binary data (0s and 1s).  
- The output signals (e.g., Dout1, Dout2) represent the results of computation.

**Summary:**  
High-level code → Compiler → Assembly → Assembler → Machine Code → Hardware Execution
