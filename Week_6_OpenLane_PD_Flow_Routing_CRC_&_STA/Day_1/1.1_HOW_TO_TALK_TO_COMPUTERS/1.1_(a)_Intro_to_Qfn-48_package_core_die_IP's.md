### Introduction to QFN-48 Package, chip, pads, core, die and IPs
Arduino Board:- This is an arduino microcontroller board. The encircled area shows the chip(microprocessor) which is interfaced with other components of the board. The designing of this chip from abstract level all the way down to the fabrication is done by RTL to GDSll flow.Arduino consists of both a physical programmable circuit board (often referred to as a microcontroller) and a piece of software, or IDE (Integrated Development Environment) that runs on the computer, used to write and upload computer code to the physical board.

### chip components
(1) Pads: Through which we can send the signal inside the chip.

(2) Core: Place where all the logic gates are fixed.

(3) Die: Present at the corner. it is the size of the entire chip.

**EX. RISC-V SoC:- It consist of SRAM,SOC,ADC,DAC,SPI these all are called foundary IP's.All devices depends upon foundary where all chips are fabricated using deposition and lithography techniques and so on.**

# 🧠 Introduction to RISC-V

**RISC-V** (pronounced *“risk-five”*) is an **open-source Instruction Set Architecture (ISA)** based on the principles of **Reduced Instruction Set Computing (RISC)**.  
Unlike proprietary ISAs (like ARM or x86), RISC-V is **free to use, modify, and implement**, making it ideal for **academia, research, and industry**.

## 🚀 Key Features
- **Open and royalty-free** – no licensing cost.
- **Modular design** – base integer ISA with optional extensions (e.g., M for multiply/divide, F for floating-point).
- **Scalable** – supports everything from small microcontrollers to high-performance processors.
- **Community-driven** – developed under the **RISC-V International** organization.

## 💡 Applications
Used in:
- Embedded systems and IoT
- AI/ML accelerators
- Custom SoC designs
- Academic research and teaching

## 📘 Example
Example base instruction set:  
`RV32I` → 32-bit base integer ISA  
`RV64IMAFD` → 64-bit with integer, multiply/divide, atomic, float, and double-float extensions

# 🧩 Die, Core, and Pads in an Integrated Circuit (IC)

## 📘 Overview
The image illustrates the **layout structure of an integrated circuit (IC)**, showing the relationship between the **Die**, **Core**, and **Pads**.

---

### ⚙️ Components

#### 🧠 Core
- The **core** is the central functional region of the chip.
- It contains the **digital logic**, **memory**, and **analog circuits** that perform computation and control.
- Operates at lower voltages (e.g., 1.8V) for energy efficiency.

#### 🔌 Pads
- **Pads** are the **input/output connection points** around the die.
- They provide electrical access to internal signals for packaging and PCB connections.
- Include power pins (e.g., `vdd3v3`, `vdd1v8`, `vss`) and signal pins (`gpio`, `adc`, `ser_tx`, etc.).
- Each pad connects to the chip’s internal circuitry through **bond wires** during packaging.

#### 💠 Die
- The **die** is the small piece of silicon cut from a wafer that contains the **core** and **pads**.
- It is the physical form of the chip before packaging.
- Surrounded by pads on its perimeter for external interfacing.

### 🧵 Summary
In short,  
- **Core** = Functional logic  
- **Pads** = Interface connections  
- **Die** = Entire silicon chip containing both
