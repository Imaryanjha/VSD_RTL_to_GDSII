## 🧠 Overview

This figure demonstrates the **complete VLSI design flow** using **RISC-V architecture** — from writing a high-level C program to generating its **physical layout** ready for fabrication using open-source EDA tools.

It represents the link between **software (instruction-level)** and **hardware (circuit-level)** design.

## 🧩 Left Side — RISC-V Architecture (Software to Assembly)

### 🔹 Step 1: Writing the Source Code
A simple C program named `swap.c` is written:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

swap (size_t my[], size_t s)
{
    size_t temp;
    temp = my[s];
    my[s] = my[s+1];
    my[s+1] = temp;
}
```
**This program swaps two elements in an array.**

---
## 🔹 Step 2: Compilation and Disassembly

The program is compiled using the RISC-V GCC toolchain and disassembled using:
```
riscv64-unknown-elf-objdump -d swap.o
```

**This converts the compiled object file (swap.o) into RISC-V assembly instructions.**



## 🔹 Step 3: What It Represents

Each line corresponds to a RISC-V instruction.

**These instructions describe how the processor executes the swap function step-by-step.**

This is the Instruction Set Architecture (ISA) level, showing the bridge between high-level programming and hardware operation.

**Hence, the RISC-V Architecture defines how the processor interprets and executes each instruction.**

# 🧱 Right Side — Layout Generation (Qflow / Physical Design)
## 🔹 Step 4: RTL-to-GDSII Flow

After verification at the RTL (Register Transfer Level), the design is passed through a physical design flow using Qflow, which includes:

Synthesis – Converts Verilog RTL code into a gate-level netlist (using Yosys).

Placement – Determines the position of standard cells (using GrayWolf).

Routing – Connects all logic gates with metal layers (using QRouter).

Layout View – The final physical arrangement of cells and interconnects, visualized using Magic.

## 🔹 Step 5: What the Layout Shows

The right image shows the layout view:

Each colored block (e.g., OAI21X1, DFFPOSX1, INVX8) represents a standard cell such as:

**Logic gates (AND, OR, INV)**

**Flip-flops (DFF)**

**Buffers (BUF)**

**The pink and blue layers represent metal routing layers connecting these cells.**

**The “FILL” cells are added to maintain uniform density for manufacturing.**

**This layout is generated automatically based on timing and area constraints.**

## This process demonstrates the complete open-source ASIC flow:
```
✔ C code → RISC-V ISA → RTL → Gates → Layout → Silicon
```
